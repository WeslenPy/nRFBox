<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project
nRFBOX is a wireless toolkit designed to explore, analyze, and interact with various wireless communication protocols. It combines the ESP32 Wroom32U, NRF24 modules, an OLED display, and other components to create a multifunctional device that can act as a scanner, analyzer, jammer, BLE jammer, BLE spoofer, and perform advanced tasks such as the "Sour Apple" attack.
